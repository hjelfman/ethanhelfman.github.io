Howdy! My name is Hazel H. (though I have gone by many names in the past). I've worked in large-scale manufacturing, wet labs, machine learning, Alzheimer's research, coding (backend and frontend), politics, the Texas government (via tech support), museums (docent and exhibits maintenance), and retail. From this terrible hodgepodge arises this website. I'm about to graduate from UT Austin with a degree in Chemical Engineering and another in Plan II (Liberal Arts major). My main projects at the moment are computer-aided recognition of Alzheimers fibrils via computer vision and writing (and whichever job I have at the moment). Any more in-detail biography will have to be gleaned from my writing.

### I. 

> "When an individual makes an attempt to see his shadow, he becomes aware of (and often ashamed of) those qualities and impulses he denies in himself but can plainly see in other people -- such things as egotism, mental laziness, and sloppiness; unreal fantasies, schemes, and plots; inordinate love of money and posessions; in short, all the little sins about which he might have previously told himself: "that doesn't matter; nobody will notice it, and in any case, other people do it too."

I've recently moved quite a few times in the past few years; the first from Dallas to Austin, living in a musty dorm with a roommate who said less than one-hundred words to me before being sent back home due to COVID; then from home to my first apartment, a yellow house in Austin where I paid $697/month in rent in exchange for a hallway-sized bedroom, an underperforming HVAC system which would cap the house at no more than ninety degrees during our moving-out party, repeated splinters in my feet, and a few life-long friends, then to Davenport, Iowa, in a former newspaper press building forty miles away from my work at a chemical plant; back to Austin in a duplex; back to Davenport in a windowless room in an office building which I kept at 64F; back to Austin in a twenty-person housing co-op with murals on the walls where I would cook dinner for everyone with someone else on Wednesdays, and finally to Houston, Texas -- of note is that I did not have a lease in either December of 2022 or 2023, staying with family in Washington D.C., on friends' and family's couches, and in hostels instead. Over the course of traveling through these stations, I've had the pleasure of meeting _a lot_ of people (without including other trips I've made) -- and for a select few, displeasure.

In interrogating why dislike toward a person begins to form the answer is not obvious; it is difficult to pin down the exact combination of traits from which a distaste begins to form, especially because I tend to take a likeing to most people I talk to! Reflecting on this from a safe distance, that which differentiates this group is their possession of traits which remind me of a trait I too hold in part in conjunction with another which I find exaggerated or negative.

I first realized this when in a group with a (now) friend of mine. She would repeatedly make requests of others which I found to be extreme, and a dislike started to brew. Unjustified as it was, I spent a long time thinking about why it was -- because she was asking for favors which I had prevented myself from asking on the grounds of politeness. My view of "decorum" was different from hers. This was unfair to both her and myself, and it revealed a self-imposed limitation which I decided to stop following (in part). You can just ask people for things and more often than not, they'll say yes. This pattern follows for many other self-imposed restrictions; another I used to have was an extreme annoyance at people who acted in certain attention-grabbing ways in public. While I still do not go quite to their extremes, this dislike was founded out of a fear that I would  be judged if I acted a certain way. Ultimately, those people are happier not laboring under a self-imposed burden. These problems are exacerbated if the offending individual is a member of a group I belong to.

The list could go on for pages, but two other traits of note which fall in this category are emotional openness and (percieved) laziness. My issues with the first are unfortunately evident to people who know me and despite recognition of the problem it remains an issue -- even now, this is a rationalization of emotion (not to say that I haven't made steps toward working on this). The second is still detangling itself, but in general, I have issues slowing down; I always have to be doing something, reading, running, working, etc. Laziness is a deficiency in this trait and it remains an open question as to what the ideal level of activity is.

### II. 

Traits emergent in social interaction sing a different tune; some evidence arises only through the friction of one with another. Much of ourselves is obscured and impenetrable no matter how much one would like to know. Between logic and love people fall to the extremes' the overly logical decry sentimentality to be an incorrect signal and lovers cast logic as missing the point. To become a more whole person, we must be able to at least wear the mask of the other and fully inhabit the others' role; the logician not just understanding why another feels that way but actually feeling it, not only to be better for others but to find that they have been experiencing spurts of love all the time unknowingly. A lover must be able to wear the calculating mask as well and recognizing the calculus of their situation. Oftentimes, people who have been too far to one side will oscillate between the extremes.

These endpoints are defined and found oin relation to other people and viewing the full range of personality is necessar; an analysis in isolation is only theoretical.

### III.

As a disclosure, I+II were fully written to myself somewhere in the past. I recently reread two pieces of mine -- a draft of my coming out letter and something that I wrote for TDOV, and it seems that I am a significantly changed person from that who wrote these. The letter, two yyears ago, makes some points but is also suffused with a mania and narrativization of myself which was ultimately unsustainable. The second is reined-in, but overly concerned with others' perception of me, trying to assure both others and myself that I was doing fine.

This year, I am far more concerned with other topics. The quality of trans-ness does not come up often in my day to day life as I settle into a new routine and meet people who are either unconcerned with or do not notice this trait. The narrativization of my life doesn't hinge as much on a series of decisions.

My grandfather died in January, surrounded by his kids and grandkids, with a stream of hundreds through his hospital room to wish him farewell. The day he passed, I woke up having slept on a couch outside of his bedroom, picked up donuts for his nurses, dropped them off, went to his room, and five minutes after my grandmother arrived, he passed. I told the nurses that he died and went outside to smoke. It was a nice day outside.

The image of my grandfather immobilized as everyone who had cared for him streamed through his room won't leave my head. As far as death goes, I think it was one of the more perfect goodbyes. Something about my priorities has shifted -- insofar life has a central meaning, it is defined by those around you; an emergent quality within and between the relationships you form over the course of life. I'm not so sure that life is a series of summits anymore.

### IV.

By the accounts of all the people who came through the room, my grandfather was a different person among different groups of people; some qualities remained the same while others shone via reflection in a well-placed group of people. I'm coming to think that the self is a nebulous, ill-defined concept, subject to change through experience, interaction, and play, and that this pattern replicates itself to the top -- death is the disappearance of the self from this world and with it a hole forms which's shape reveals that which was left. I think that I want to be a better, more connected graph when my time comes.

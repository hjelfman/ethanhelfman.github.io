### Excerpt of a speech by former NASA head Daniel S. Goldin (1993)

	As our knowledge of the universe outside our Local Group has grown, we must face the fact that we will never be able to gain insight into the origins of the universe with current technology. Light-based telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which utilizes only the ultraviolet, visible, and IR spectrums, are able to see approximately ten billion years in the past at the cost of image quality and accuracy. Knowing the Hubble constant is an important step in our knowledge of the universe, but we have reached a wall. […]

### Project Proposal – James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) (2004)

	A decade ago, it was said that we will never be able to delve into the secrets of the universe. We may have found a way around this. The HST was limited to three miniscule portions of the electromagnetic spectrum; shifting our frame to a different portion of the EM spectrum alone will do nothing to increase our reach.
	
	The solution to this problem has been with us since the thirties. Satyendra Bose predicted the existence of a macro-scale quantum state in 1925; Einstein followed up with a practical paper in 1925. At low temperatures, approximating zero Kelvin, a gas can operate at its lowest quantum state, and we can view these effects at a human-visible scale. Particularly of interest is the gas’ quantum interference; at this temperature, the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) may act as a wave until observed. This wave may replicate the qualities of a wave at another point; by guiding the point at which the wave is replicated, we can observe objects at a distance much further than the ten-billion-year limit at up to a 1:1 scale.
	
	We propose that this technology be available for the JWST[…]

### JWST Operational Report (2022)

	As of March 21st, 2022, the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) has reached operational temperature. The BEC, composed of He-4, is spun at high speeds, forming it into a disk, similar to that of a mercury mirror. Simultaneously, the disk’s energy leaches into space, reducing its thermal signature to that of the universal vacuum. This allows it to reach the conditions necessary to form the BEC mirror
	. 
	To test the operational properties of the BEC, we trained it on an area of Earth (coordinates 33.762437, -84.387802), south of Marietta, GA, using viewers with no knowledge of this location. As expected, the telescope found a rural area, the telescope providing enough detail to show individual kudzu vines, allowing for the ability to pan out to the bottom of the Appalachians. This was consistent with our data of the region, confirming the tool’s functionality.
	
	In the coming months, we will train the telescope on Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the solar system. Due to a change in mission mandate, we will then view candidate exoplanets for habitation close to the Earth. With the Biden administration’s increased focus on discovering extraterrestrial life, we will edit our protocol. Given that the JWST views planets on a 1:1 scale, we are able to directly observe possible life forms on these exoplanets. After collecting this training data, we will change our gaze to Ross 128b, a planet approximately 11 light years (ly) away, which is 35% larger than Earth and may harbor liquid water.

### JWST Observational Report for Ross 128b (2022)

	Our preliminary findings show that Ross 128b fits within its pre-Hubble calculated values by <1%. The BEC mirror reflects the mass estimate of 1.35 Earths, with the similar prediction of 38% starlight also confirmed. As well, we have been able to confirm the gravitational constant of 10.95 m/s¬2.
	
	However, we have not been able to find extraterrestrial life. The atmosphere contains 79% N2, 20.5% O2, and the remainder Noble gasses and CO2, which is consistent with organic life. Organic hydrocarbons are also present on the surface, containing amino acids and proto-proteins reminiscent of what would be found on Earth. However, no self-replicating life with a genetic code has been discovered. 
	
	The next candidate for a habitable exoplanet is Luyten B. While 2.9x the mass of Earth, it receives a similar amount of light from Luyten’s Star, resulting in an average temperature of two-hundred nine Kelvin. We will observe it with the BEC beginning next month.

### 61-Virginis B Observational Report

	Initial observations of 61-Virginis B showed an absence of extraterrestrial life similar to that of other planets, with a habitable atmosphere and evidence of organic molecules, but nothing that could be termed as life. Planetary data fit our expectations within 1%, demonstrating the same error from prediction seen in other viewings of exoplanets. This indicates our models’ remarkable ability to predict planetary object properties even without BECs. This lack of error would be considered a statistical anomaly in other scientific fields.
	
	Upon inspection of the planets surface without the BEC mirror, a reflective surface was found covering 0.1% of the planet’s surface. The BEC mirror was subsequently employed to observe details upon the surface. 
	
	The BEC found that the aberration is composed of copper and tin, forming a bronze alloy. Of note is that both these elements are cosmically rare; the probability of this alloy forming by chance is approximately zero. Upon greater analysis of the top layer, regular etchings were found which correspond to no natural process found to date. Further analysis is needed to determine the origin of these etchings.

### 61-Virginis B Observational Report – Etching Analysis

	[…]
	
	Given that there is no natural phenomenon which correlates to the manner of markings on the surface, our minds turned to a more extraterrestrial origin, though there were no signs of organic or silicon-based life on the planet. Quine’s thesis regarding indeterminacy of translation remained a significant issue for any non-terrestrial translation. First, indeterminacy of reference – meaning that we do not know to what the phrasing refers to in isolation – meant that any initial translation would need a Rosetta Stone of sorts. A lesser issue is holophrastic indeterminacy – that a phrase may have multiple meanings. Now, with more advanced categorization technology such as DeepMind, we can conduct a probabilistic analysis of any translated phrase, resulting in the most likely solution for an excerpt. However, we happened across a Rosetta Stone.
	
	As we know, the Earth has been broadcasting radio signals since 1893. Apparently, something has been listening. When using the BEC with a radio component of the JWST, a signal was found to interfere with viewing of 61-Virginis B, with the origin of the signal in the upper-left corner of the metallic surface. As the radio telescope aboard the JWST is intended to view radio signals emitted from nebulae and the like, the raw signal from the BEC was sent directly to Earth via antenna-1. Upon reception of the signal, a transmission more familiar to Earth was found, in a 1800s-era form of Italian. Below is the following transcript:
	
> “Abbiamo rilevato una trasmissione proveniente dal vostro pianeta molti anni fa. Data la quantità di dati che abbiamo ricevuto, siamo stati in grado di capire. Abbiamo deciso di aspettare fino a…”

### 61-Virginis B Emission - English Translation

	> A transmission of three signals first alerted us to your presence. Upon reception, we were able to triangulate the location of your planet, deciding to leave it alone due to the differences in technology between your planet and ours. Over the years, we began to detect an increasing number of signals from the same place, such that your world was a supernova of radio-wave emission, as you termed it. Still, we left you alone. We detected bursts of nuclear energy, and again, we left you alone. When the time came, we would contact your world.
	
	> You were not alone; there were several worlds we kept tabs on. You ought to be familiar with them. However, as time went on, we began to lose them. The world closest to you, once teeming with life, was reduced to a barren earth. Then the next, and so on. You may have been spared, but it seems that we are next. 
	
	> This message has been inscribed on a non-organic material; we hope that this prevents it from succumbing to the barrenness that the other worlds have fallen to. If nothing else, we hope that this is remembered.

### Proposal to Decommission JWST-BEC

	The JWST working BEC sub-team would like to pass forward a proposal to decommission the JWST-BEC under the following grounds:
	
	<u>Background of BEC Technology</u>
	- The BEC entangles with a distant object in order to view minute details of a surface
	- To receive information from a distance, the BEC must collapse its wavefunction through observation
	
	<u>New Findings</u>
	- Both the BEC and distant object undergo wavefunction collapse when observed
	- This wavefunction collapses irreversibly into the lowest-energy thermodynamic state
	- The form of wavefunction collapse is itself a function of the epistemics of the observer
		- That is, the more thermodynamically stable state is not a constant
		- The most probable state is that which the BEC observer expects
	<u>Conclusion</u>
	
	We have assumed, as with most remote-viewing equipment, that what we see reflects reality. However, by collapsing the wavefunction of a remote object, what we expect becomes reality. Thus, while the BEC observes the universe, it sets it in stone, irreversibly. Functionally, it impresses the viewers expected findings as actual ones, regardless of the prior objective state. As a result, we move to decommission the JWST BEC functionality.
	
	<u>Addendum</u>
	Denied by NASA Advisory Council

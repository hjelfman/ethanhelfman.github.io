# Manic March - Media Recommendations

This one is calling it in a bit – I have a lot of work to do today and not that much time to do it, so for this entry, I wanted to mention 2-3 of my favorite pieces of media and why I chose them

### Focusing – Eugene T. Gendlin
This book was written by a psychologist trying to find commonalities between his most effective patients, theorizing that they share an ability to concentrate on and identify a feeling that they’ve been working on. He then proceeds to generalize this process to a set of instructions that most can follow. While not the only solution to one’s problems, I’ve found his process incredibly helpful. However, my favorite section discusses how to inspire this process in others; essentially, how to ask guiding and revealing questions while actively listening. This has come in handy for me multiple times and has helped me get to know others better while helping them. Especially for someone who could be better at asking the right questions, I heavily recommend this book.

### And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic – Randy Shilts
This book covers the early days of the AIDS epidemic, doing an amazing job of portraying the various facets of the response from bureaucratic, scientific, social, activist, and health sectors of society. It illustrates various themes that have been repeated in the COVID-19 pandemic: resistance to protective responses, failures of health agencies to take the issue seriously, reactionary elements toward health measures, non-response of bureaucracy to lifesaving treatment, and so on. In general, it is one of the many demonstrations of the general apathy of the public as a minority of Others are harmed, and it is a necessary read due to that fact alone. Aside from this, you should look at the [AIDS quilt](https://www.aidsmemorial.org/interactive-aids-quilt), which was recently digitized, and never fails to make me think about it for the rest of the day.

### The Last Days of Judas Iscariot – Stephen Adly Guirgis
I think about this play often. The plot of this play is that Judas Iscariot, the ultimate betrayer, is on trial in Purgatory for whether he was truly responsible for Jesus’ death. Satan, Mother Theresa, Freud, Saint Thomas, Jesus, Saint Peter, and others all appear on the stand to defend, attack, or inform the audience of Judas’ innocence. Due to a writ signed by G-d, the judge of Purgatory is forced to hear Judas’ case. I enjoyed this play more than most I’ve read to the point where I held a reading of it on Zoom when we were all quarantined. However, its main theme is forgiveness, both from others and to yourself; how one must forgive themselves. Even if others forgive you, you must forgive yourself. And, even if others can’t, you need to learn to live with it. I am not going to spoil how this is taught, but it’s a theme I find myself coming back to, that one ought to find forgiveness for others whenever possible, for there are redeemable qualities in everyone.

### What is Manic March?

On Feburary 27, 2022, I thought it would be a great idea to create some sort of content - writing, art, coding, etc. - every day of the next month. Luckily, the alliteration worked out. This should be the sixth post in the series.

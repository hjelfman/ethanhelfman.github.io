### a voice like a fine crystal

He stole it from you.

He took your divinity; shattering it on the hardwood until it’s pieces blended with the grain of the oak, melding with the blood on the floor (yours), semen (his), tears (both), Diet Coke, all flowing into the carpet, ensuring that you’ll not get your security deposit back. And with a final scream, one that scratches the back of your throat, straining your already-stretched vocal chords, raising your larynx and up through your extended, bloody tongue, any remnant of your divinity floats off into the sky. The shards on the floor and the ephemera of the rest already gone, an echo of an echo that will call for help seven minutes from now; by then, not a single person will be in the room. He drops you to the floor, useless, as you plunge through fractal after fractal, looking for any universe in which this did not happen; all other escape routes, of course, being sealed off. Any universe where this was a nonoccurence is so trivial, that of a worse end, that you have no choice but to remain in the oak floor, lying in both of your remains. An eternity passes and you’re still on the floor. Another, and you haven’t moved an inch. Not like you could.

As a final betrayal, your eyes still work, able to survey your lost divinity and broken body. Each  cell is not your own, encoding an alien genetics. No guide RNA could shift an A to a C. Each bone is different, the marrow extending to the periosteum ensuring that you will never walk the same, if you could walk at all. At the angle your legs and arms are splayed out at, who knows? Another eternity passes. The door clicks; whether that’s him leaving, you can’t even give the effort to contract the fine muscles of your neck to look up. There’s just the swirling fractal patterns of the hardwood, that grain which courses like a river, showing you all the ways your life could have been different and diverged to a different path. If you had not shared a room. If you had not attended this place. If you had been better. Had you tried, things would have been different. The path of the river continues, flowing further down into eternity until the door clicks again. There is no person in this room worth saving.

Arms scoop you up with cotton sleeves. Each fiber of the shirt grates across your skin, cutting in each and every place already damaged, eliciting what little blood left in your body. Platelets erupt to the surface; just enough to quench what is left, not enough to stop the cotton from staining. Another beautiful thing you’ve ruined. You twitch, a first movement in several infinities’ worth of time, and you’re held ever-tighter.

this is a collection of every book i have read since i became a person or w/e. i've dropped books which i didn't enjoy enough to remember and those which had minimal effect on me.

- the left behind: decline and rage in rural america

being from texas i eventually want to write something about the rise in overt christian nationalism. that will come at a later date; regardless, this is supposed to be a sympathetic look at rural america from the perspective of the coastal elites, and it does quite a good job doing so. however, as someone who is not a coastal elite -- get me out of here!! yes, they are misinformed. no, there is no fixing the issues with rural america. rural lifestyles are already subsidized enough by the government; personally, i think we should end corn and soy subsidies. furthermore, the community-style living the book describes is both good and will also inevitably decline over the next fifty years, not just because of deindustrialization and brain drain, but also as the internet accelerates the ever-present isolation of rural communities. these moral communities will not make it out of the near future.

- the social origins of language

ok so i believe that language, while dependent on people, has kind of become its own alien thing which hijacks our minds. usually when i talk about this people tell me to shut up for very good reasons. this book was informative as it describes how language came to be as an increasingly-complex system for social signaling. those who can properly signal danger and coordinate with others survived more often, and it turns out that more complex systems increase the level of detail one can use to signal their status, a threat, etc. it's a really good foundation for my b.s. but i need to find a book which discusses the idea of lying.

- the decline and fall of the roman empire

this book was definitely an indulgence; the author clearly has preconceptions about how the world ought to be and they bleed through, though in a way you can identify thankfully. regardless, it is a very well-written work and the details of the characters of the emperors were interesting to me; the faults of those in the past are not much different than those of today, and as a result this book feels very human.
  
- mrs. dalloway

i love virginia woolf's writing so much. that's all.
  
- aspects of the masculine

carl jung is very interesting and though he is definitely Woo, its an entertaining read. his discussion of the anima, animus, and the takeover of the person by either feels both incorrect and gesturing at something which exists.

- a confederacy of dunces

this is a character study of a type of guy who is somewhat common in stem spaces, overrepresented online, and in graduates of my high school. i want to get these groups to read this book, and upon seeing themselves reflected in ignatius, change everything about themselves and turn their ambitions into action. just a pipe dream

- never eat alone

i picked this up at a free library while waiting for my job to start. the whole "talk to people and make friends with them, keep in contact" is good advice, but its one of those books which could have been a tweet.
  
- wittgenstein's mistress

i read this in one night while at a mediocre show at a bar. it felt like my brain was being dipped in acid -- very enjoyable.

- india: a history

when i took world history, we mostly skipped over indian history, just discussing mohenjo-daro, the mughals, and the raj, and i've felt that asia is generally a blind spot for me. this book attempts to cover all of indian history from pre-civilization to present and it does a good job at doing so with a high-level summary. unfortunately, given my lack of prior knowledge on the topic, i am unable to assess the ways in which this work would be biased, but it succeeded in informing me about an area i have little knowledge in.

- how to hide an empire

how to hide an empire would probably be really good if i weren't a very online leftist for a majority of my adult life (and before that, i read a peoples' history at 12 because i was a weird kid)! america's colonialism is very underdiscussed (though we did at least talk about the philippines in high school) and it does a great job in covering that; it just wasn't informative for me but for the parts on macarthur. what was his problem.

this is cheating because i first read this in high school about the same time i read the brief wondrous life of oscar wao, which is a very similar book stylistically (turns out that this is because imogen binnie was inspired by junot diaz!). as someone who was in both character's positions at different points in my life, it's hard to write something unbiased about it. i like that maria is not a good person! her girlfriend's assessment of her is essentially right, and binnie does an amazing job of capturing maria's narrativization which assists with All of That; i have suffered from similar issues at times in that i am a chronic bullshitter and its nice being trashed in a book.

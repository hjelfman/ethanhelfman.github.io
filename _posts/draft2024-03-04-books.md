this is a collection of every book i have read since i became a person or w/e. i've dropped books which i didn't enjoy enough to remember and those which had minimal effect on me.

- the left behind: decline and rage in rural america

being from texas i eventually want to write something about the rise in overt christian nationalism. that will come at a later date; regardless, this is supposed to be a sympathetic look at rural america from the perspective of the coastal elites, and it does quite a good job doing so. however, as someone who is not a coastal elite -- get me out of here!! yes, they are misinformed. no, there is no fixing the issues with rural america. rural lifestyles are already subsidized enough by the government; personally, i think we should end corn and soy subsidies. furthermore, the community-style living the book describes is both good and will also inevitably decline over the next fifty years, not just because of deindustrialization and brain drain, but also as the internet accelerates the ever-present isolation of rural communities. these moral communities will not make it out of the near future.

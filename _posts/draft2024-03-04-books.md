this is a collection of every book i have read since i became a person or w/e. i've dropped books which i didn't enjoy enough to remember and those which had minimal effect on me.

- the left behind: decline and rage in rural america

being from texas i eventually want to write something about the rise in overt christian nationalism. that will come at a later date; regardless, this is supposed to be a sympathetic look at rural america from the perspective of the coastal elites, and it does quite a good job doing so. however, as someone who is not a coastal elite -- get me out of here!! yes, they are misinformed. no, there is no fixing the issues with rural america. rural lifestyles are already subsidized enough by the government; personally, i think we should end corn and soy subsidies. furthermore, the community-style living the book describes is both good and will also inevitably decline over the next fifty years, not just because of deindustrialization and brain drain, but also as the internet accelerates the ever-present isolation of rural communities. these moral communities will not make it out of the near future.

- the social origins of language

ok so i believe that language, while dependent on people, has kind of become its own alien thing which hijacks our minds. usually when i talk about this people tell me to shut up for very good reasons. this book was informative as it describes how language came to be as an increasingly-complex system for social signaling. those who can properly signal danger and coordinate with others survived more often, and it turns out that more complex systems increase the level of detail one can use to signal their status, a threat, etc. it's a really good foundation for my b.s. but i need to find a book which discusses the idea of lying.

- the decline and fall of the roman empire

this book was definitely an indulgence; the author clearly has preconceptions about how the world ought to be and they bleed through, though in a way you can identify thankfully. regardless, it is a very well-written work and the details of the characters of the emperors were interesting to me; the faults of those in the past are not much different than those of today, and as a result this book feels very human.
  
- mrs. dalloway

i love virginia woolf's writing so much. that's all.
  
- aspects of the masculine

carl jung is very interesting and though he is definitely Woo, its an entertaining read. his discussion of the anima, animus, and the takeover of the person by either feels both incorrect and gesturing at something which exists.

- a confederacy of dunces

this is a character study of a type of guy who is somewhat common in stem spaces, overrepresented online, and in graduates of my high school. i want to get these groups to read this book, and upon seeing themselves reflected in ignatius, change everything about themselves and turn their ambitions into action. just a pipe dream

- never eat alone

i picked this up at a free library while waiting for my job to start. the whole "talk to people and make friends with them, keep in contact" is good advice, but its one of those books which could have been a tweet.
  
- wittgenstein's mistress

i read this in one night while at a mediocre show at a bar. it felt like my brain was being dipped in acid -- very enjoyable.

- india: a history

when i took world history, we mostly skipped over indian history, just discussing mohenjo-daro, the mughals, and the raj, and i've felt that asia is generally a blind spot for me. this book attempts to cover all of indian history from pre-civilization to present and it does a good job at doing so with a high-level summary. unfortunately, given my lack of prior knowledge on the topic, i am unable to assess the ways in which this work would be biased, but it succeeded in informing me about an area i have little knowledge in.

- how to hide an empire

how to hide an empire would probably be really good if i weren't a very online leftist for a majority of my adult life (and before that, i read a peoples' history at 12 because i was a weird kid)! america's colonialism is very underdiscussed (though we did at least talk about the philippines in high school) and it does a great job in covering that; it just wasn't informative for me but for the parts on macarthur. what was his problem.
  
- stone butch blues
 
i put off reading this book for years and i should not have; i had dismissed it as a book "from the other side" that i wouldn't enjoy and as a result nearly missed out on one of the best books i read in 2023. feinberg's experiences (yes i know this book isn't strictly autobiographical -- regardless) growing up straddle a line between relatable and alien, and her struggles with femininity, choosing to take testosterone, and (especially) her eventual detransition hit close to home.

- the world of the shining prince

again, i have a major blind spot surrounding asia; this book was another attempt to see into an alien culture, especially pre-westernization.

- little blue encyclopedia

solid trans fiction. not much to say - some parts reminded me of my friendships with others which i've made and (in some cases) lost. i suppose that the feeling of premature loss is all too common in trans spaces, and that hurts, a lot.

- autumn in the heavenly kingdom

another blind-spot book! this was some of the most gripping historical non-fiction i have ever read. the author does such a good job detailing troop and high-ranking figures' movements and the increasing sense of desperation from the rebels. this is an almost-theatrical event in chinese history.

- the red book

i have a fascination with carl jung; the stories he recounts in this book were formed by a process i would call "active dreaming" while awake. it almost feels as if it should belong in a fiction section instead of psychology, but some of the insights he gains strike close to home, though i am suspect of the reasons for this. it seems either that 1) early-1900s psychology has embedded itself into the way we think now or 2) that they genuinely did find something in the human psyche and sometimes i tend toward 1).
  
- orlando

see longer writeup

- nixon agonistes

with enough self-hatred you can really do anything.

- kushiel's dart; kushiel's chosen; kushiel's avatar

combining this series for convenience' sake. this series is 85% palace intrigue in an alternate universe mediterranean where christianity got replaced by a cult of eros and 15% smut. it's really, really good and i could not put it down -- i think i read all 3000 pages within the span of a week. palace intrigue is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. the range of cultures, characters, and depth of history built into this series make it a very good read even if the other 15% isn't your thing.

- humble pi

geared toward a different audience.
  
- dao de jing

another blind spot book. ultimately good, but i feel like there's a good amount of context i don't have which keeps me from evaluating this book though its broader themes are probably good for the anxious generation to internalize.

- animal money

this book, like wittgenstein's mistress, made me feel as if my brain were melting, and i loved it! indescribably good -- its a book about the cult of economics. it feels like what the scpwiki is trying to do. it felt like there was somebody behind me watching me read it; like the book itself would suck me in as i find myself in an alien world untethered from all signifiers which distinguish objects from each other.

- never let me go

people which read this book and think that it is a critique of government/omelas/etc are missing the point a little bit. it is, but only in the same way that the barbie movie is about feminism. it's actually all about death, and living a meaningful one in the face of its eventuality.

- a room of one's own

this is what got me into virginia woolf -- i read this for a womens' autobiography class in college. it discusses a material component of womens' independence that a lot of (what i want to say popular, cultural, folk, along these lines) feminism lacks. as well, woolfs writing is just wonderful.

- indiana

this book was recommended to me by the same professor as above. i really like george sand; her writing is a sliver of a much different world for women than what we have now. i am thankful for these changes though oddly wistful for delinated social customs.
  
- the iliad

i never had much exposure to the classics; this was an attempt at it. though the poetry was beautiful, again, this book was about death to me, the wanton killing of youth in their prime, their ancestors listed behind them. it's a different way to look at dying in battle. maybe this is one of the things that modern warfare changed (not for the better or worse - just different).
  
- the woman warrior

womens' autobiography book. the replication of close family ties and reconciling how an aged family member has acted in the past and present is not yet something i have had the chance to fully realize; this was a look into the future.
  
- the house on mango street

womens' autobiography book. not a short-narrative fan.

- the devil's pool

the past is an alien world; george sand does a great job of writing about how women lived in a time different from ours.

- francois the waif

see above.

- writing a woman's life
 
this is a book in part about gender roles and how they shape the way a woman tends to view her life; it is also about the traditional "lifecycle" of a woman in a way that is both antiquated due to the perpetual adolescence demanded of us and the dissolution of gender roles overall. it's from a different time but still holds some wisdom.

- i know why the caged bird sings

america's history is closer than we think.
  
- the closing of the american mind

bloom is right in part; a lot of his critiques feel like an antiquated version of the bridge to meta-rationality. i do believe that "great books" are genuinely better, but also am unsure what to do with that -- they lost a long time ago, and with ever-diminishing attention spans, i do not think that they're coming back, which is a shame. also, he's just right with the commodification of rebellion. if anything, it's gotten worse. his critique of relativism is right in that i have met people who fit the mold he's describing; wrong in that some have good reasons to adopt these positions. his last section on the decline of love is interesting given the increases in anxiety in gen Z. finally, the freedom of speech discussion is solid, though this does put me at odds with a current strain of thought at colleges. however, the solution is probably to move away from the institution of college, which will probably never happen.
  
- moby dick

this book got me into reading the "classics" -- it's incredibly enjoyable and the experiences of the book despite being divorced from anything which i would experience now are still universal.
  
- journal of a solitude

not actually a solitude
  
- any other city

trans lit. don't remember.
  
- the yellow wallpaper

omg she's literally me

- sylvia plath: collected poems

omg she's literally me
  
- our [redacted]

i'm from the south and oftentimes the horrors of slavery are slighted in schools' instruction and this was a very good book which counters some of this intentional mistelling.

- biography of x

good romance novel with an unreliable protagonist! if you're grappling with the concept of (auto)biography this book makes it more difficult (good). also, the world-building in this book is top-notch; an alternate-history america which reuses some tropes of a theocratic south while avoiding some of the more stereotypical liberties books like this take.
  
- the amazon and the page

read this during my womens' autobiography class as a potential alternative to the biography of x after finding out about it on twitter. enjoyable.

- the muse of the violets

good poetry, though there is something missing as it was translated from french.
  
- king, queen, knave

not much to say.
  
- my year of rest and relaxation

i think that people get the wrong idea from this book, either romanticizing their rot-girl aesthetic or taking it as a lesson. the actual lesson is that everyone in this book is a terrible person and also that a lesser suicide is still bad.
  
- the web of meaning

read this while traveling cross country. i don't think its right but can see scenarios in which this way of thinking would be useful.
  
- dorley

very enjoyable wish-fulfillment fiction
  
- pale fire

love an unreliable narrarator. the prose is excellent as always.
  
- there is no antimemetics division

this was good! it'd be better freed from the format of an scp however, and i like the concept of antimemes in general.
  
- our wives under the sea

horror-romance about the end of a relationship. 
  
- the fifth wound

trans-lit that makes my brain feel like its dissolving (best-in-class).
  
- infect your friends and loved ones

solid trans-short-story!
  
- dykes to watch out for

main takeaways: there is nothing new under the sun and everything we argue about will remain forever.

- tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow

i was skeptical of this book as it was an airport bestseller about the videogame industry; i finished it on the flight and its actually a really good book about dying.
  
- a dream of a woman

trans-lit :)
  
- i like you: hospitality under the influence

needed something to read on an emergency flight -- very funny and made me want to host more dinner parties.
  
- the anthropocene reviewed

read this on a flight after the end of a six-year relationship. green's thoughts on a consistent mental state and the universe were actually quite touching. it was what i needed at the time.
  
- ccru

i feel like i passively absorbed the content of this book by being on the internet for 15 years but the concept of hyperstition would be pretty interesting if i hadn't.
  
- this is how you lose the time war

i like romance novels and time travel. good if you're the kinda kid who was on tumblr and liked homestuck.
  
- my lesbian experience with lonliness

unremarkable, but not for me.

- letters for my sisters

a glimpse into a different time for trans people! really good.
  
- jane eyre (x2)

one of my favorite books! i like _good_ romance and the glimpse into past gender roles is great, not to mention the story of the books' publishing. eyre's account of herself is ripe for interpretation even if you are not the kind of person who usually does that, which is possibly why this book is commonly taught.

- a desolation called peace/a memory called empire

palace intrigue in space part one and two. love it but you should look up the keyword "maz substack memory called empire" to find a better piece that gives it more thought than i will. one of my favorites.

- the bell jar

she's just like me fr. but this book seriously got me into the subgenre of women's (auto)biography. her feelings are universal and there are some points in the novel which resonate strongly with events in my past.

- blood meridian

my favorite book about gnosticism. 
  
- tragedy queens

did not like. trans-lit.

- a safe girl to love

trans-lit, good.

- summer fun

really good trans-lit based off an imaginary correspondence. top in class.

love it love it. must have rocked to be in nyc in the 70s and 80s but for...everything else and what was about to happen.

interesting! i still dislike when i can tell that i am being nudged to do something however

- the last days of judas iscariot

this is my favorite play. i was not raised christian and it still seems utterly foreign to me a lot of the time. however, the combination of biblical and historic figures is enjoyable, and i've always enjoyed art which casts judas as sympathetic.

- infinite jest

read this out of spite. unbearable but for the parts with the canadian agents.

- the geography of nowhere

if you're into yimby/car/suburb stuff read this book. its been too long to recall anything specific apart from enjoying it.

- nevada

this is cheating because i first read this in high school about the same time i read the brief wondrous life of oscar wao, which is a very similar book stylistically (turns out that this is because imogen binnie was inspired by junot diaz!). as someone who was in both character's positions at different points in my life, it's hard to write something unbiased about it. i like that maria is not a good person! her girlfriend's assessment of her is essentially right, and binnie does an amazing job of capturing maria's narrativization which assists with All of That; i have suffered from similar issues at times in that i am a chronic bullshitter and its nice being trashed in a book.

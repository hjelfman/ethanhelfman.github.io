i really do despise coming out to people; it has never really been my thing, and i am content letting people figure stuff like this out because i am very invested in what peoples' first opinions of me are. i am also very lucky in that when i see people in-person nowadays, they know what's been up, more or less, unless i deliberately choose to conceal it. but, for those who don't know, i transitioned some time ago and go by hazel. i have for quite some time.

unfortunately, i feel the need to inform y'all of this because, in fact, i have an agenda. the project of texas politics, in recent months, has been focused on a legislative assault on transgender rights, which has made me at least a little bit unhappy. while there are substantive arguments regarding our rights that i could discuss, i don't care to discuss them currently. instead, i'm arguing a more general point - that you should respect one's right to autonomy, and that there is one side in texas politics - those republicans in power - who wish to ignore this essential right. i hope for the day when texas has better people in office of both parties, and i wish for y'all to make that happen next time you're at the ballot box. you all know me, and i wish to give this issue a personal spin, giving a face to some of the people that this state legislature is discussing. 

i do want to prove to y'all that trans people are pretty normal (or alternately, to expand your definition of normal by a skosh). ultimately, it takes all kinds, you know? heres a non-exhaustive <a href="http://hjelfman.com/posts/2023/03/01/State/">summary of my year</a> if you happen to be curious, and of course, feel free to message me. this is a public facing website, so i'm not about to share my phone number, but most people reading this know where to find me :)

thank you.

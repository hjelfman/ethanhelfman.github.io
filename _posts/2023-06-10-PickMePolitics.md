### what matters is that i get to feel more self-righteous than everyone else 

The theme of assimilation versus liberation recurs unchecked throughout the history of identity politics, with the assimilationists wishing to blend into the larger society as a whole and the liberationists seeking to establish their own groups, communities, and social structures unlike those of the mainline society. Everything happens, again and again, and despite both sides declaring an end to the other, identity groups will oscillate between integration and independence in such a way to utterly defeat the progress that they themselves have made. Such is the issue of the shortsightedness and rewriting of history of social movements. Nothing is new. Was Marsha P. Johnson a transsexual or a transvestite? There is in fact an answer to this, and those within the current LGBT movement would likely say otherwise in an effort to rewrite truth to support their movement. Everything has always supported the movement in power, to say otherwise is to be ostracized.
	
The issue with liberation is the construction of the capital-Q Queer identity that is all consuming. On social media, you see it everywhere, people talking about queerness, what lines in the sand must be drawn to give one an identity, who to include and exclude, which spaces are obliged to accept each person, and so on, playing around so much in words that they simply fail to experience what this actually is. Have you tried fucking someone of the same sex? Are there, or have there ever been, or would you like to have exogenous hormones floating around in your body? Words only offer so much, having an experience is a different thing. Stop talking about things, and start doing people. You can only spend so much time figuring yourself out. Let us not forget that LGBT is an incidental grouping here.
	
I didn’t forget the assimilationists. Are you so ashamed as to pretend you don’t exist? There’s a difference between incidentally being something, spending your time only thinking about something, and not wanting to be something. Sure, a letter is not your whole identity, but it would do some good to think about those who follow after you. The path could be more well-trodden than it is now. Shame isn’t the only reason, of course. Safety looms large in the mind of anyone who wasn’t conscious until Obergefell, something that a lot of the younger generation can easily forget. And, when you’re in the rurals, people are more than free to let you know when they think you’re a menace to them and their children. I don’t mean that everybody has to know your business, but you can offer support when it’s of importance.

What was Marsha? There is a truth there, but it doesn’t matter. It shouldn’t strengthen the current incidental alliance between the L/G/B/T anymore than the basic fact that the attacks each letter faces stem from similar misguided beliefs. What matters is that people seem to either play around in the world of ideas or rest in their fears. Both are counterproductive to a thriving effort.

As for the elephant in the room - whither shall we align with - the fact of the matter is that there is a larger society that you will have to interact with. Declaring your disgust with the structures in power is difficult when those structures are inherent to an identity. This goes for everyone involved, and all offending people should sit in time-out for at least ten minutes to think about what they’ve done. In an unending game, “he did it first!” is not an excuse. The fact of the matter is that everyone is overthinking it. Be who you are among those you can.

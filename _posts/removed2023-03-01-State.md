It's been a year - an eventful year - since the start of last manic march. In the three hundred and sixty five days since the start of last year's challenge, I have:

- Killed one deer with my car
- Been to Mexico City
- Lived in Iowa for six months (working at a chemical plant)
- Visited places in Oklahoma, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New York, D.C. and Connecticut. Of the cities I was in, Minneapolis, Madison, New York City, D.C. and Baltimore rank the highest.
- Celebrated five years with my partner
- Transitioned (socially, medically) (though technically starting fifty-five weeks ago, no person but my aforementioned partner had knowledge of this)
- Stayed up for thirty-three hours continuously
- Slept four hours in a pay-by-the hour motel
- Sent four postcards
- Been involved in one near-miss incident
- Broken zero bones
- Gotten lost in a forest twice
- Been patted down by TSA five times: three times in the groin, two on the chest
- Drank ~720 black coffees
- Been elected regent of a frat
- Deposited sperm in a cup in a hotel outside of Nashville (for medical reasons)
- Nearly reached completion on an Alzheimer's/machine learning paper

There are likely items missing from the list; I do not have a great memory. However, it's been one of the longest, happiest years of my life so far. I had the false belief that my life did not have a high ceiling for positive emotions, and am overjoyed to have been proven wrong.

My goals are different than last years. Looking at last year's writings, it seemed as if I came from a much more analytical, unfeeling viewpoint, and that I was writing to exercise a muscle. This isn't a wrong way to look at things, but its rather bloodless, unfeeling, and disconnected as compared to what I feel now. And, it's quite clear to me that those articles were written by somebody grappling with their place in the world, trying to negotiate between familial, religious, personal, and romantic requests. I haven't fully unwound that Gordian knot, but the rope has slack in it now. I have space to breathe.

Over the next month, I plan to write something every day. This will be slightly difficult due to the fact that I will be driving through the West for ten of the thirty-one days of the self-appointed challenge, but I'll make it work. These snippets will be more personal and hopefully of better quality than those of last year. To the person reading this - thank you.

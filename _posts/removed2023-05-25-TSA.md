# the A in TSA stands for assault

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was founded in the aftermath of 9/11, founded upon the weak belief that an airport checkpoint can indeed guarantee security on a plane rather than provide nothing but security theater. In the wake of the most devastating terrorist attack on United States soil, a reaction such as this makes sense in that it offered a worried nation a sense of control over that which would likely have happened regardless. However, rather than improving the security of air travel, the TSA exercises its limited power in the violation of bodily autonomy. 

There have been [numerous](https://web.archive.org/web/20120814035503/https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/us/racial-profiling-at-boston-airport-officials-say.html) complaints about the TSA’s racial profiling, that South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Hispanic people are much more likely to be stopped at the airport checkpoint and patted down. These “investigations” can be incredibly invasive, with agents having the jurisdiction to perform a cavity search. In practice, this empowers normal citizens with the ability to sexually assault other citizens with impurity by being bestowed with a metal badge. The looming presence of the TSA results in mental damages, physical in the case of sexual assault, and financial in the cases of missed flights and stolen luggage, an all-too-frequent phenomenon. Racial minorities are not the only ones affected, with agents exercising their iota of power to [harass](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/09/1049814332/despite-calls-to-improve-air-travel-is-still-a-nightmare-for-many-with-disabilit) those with medical conditions, which require service animals, liquid medicines, metal implants, mobility devices, etc. No amount of training will fix the inherent flaw in the agency, in which they empower randomly selected citizens to abuse their fellow ones with no accountability, all in the name of security.

Knowing is one thing, experiencing is another. Within the past few years (with the distribution of these outcomes varying over time), I’ve experienced an issue when going through these checkpoints - [click here to roll the dice!](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu-sn&q=roll+1d3)

You walk into the full-body scanner, slightly damp, remembering yours and your friends’ past experiences going through TSA. The scanner softly whirs around you as your hands are raised over your head, legs spread. In the corner of your left eye, you can see the agent selecting something on the screen before you step forward. Another agent stands in front of you, blocking your path; the first gives the go-ahead to the second, and you’re free to go.

“Sir, do you have anything in your chest are-,” you tune out of a sentence you’ve heard a half-dozen times before as you try your hardest to send your soul out of your body. The TSA pats down your chest, stopping on the way down for a second too long, and with a look of disgust, you’re sent on your way.

“Ma’am, we’ve detected something in your groin area.” This is one you haven’t grown quite accustomed to yet.

You know what’s going to happen next, or you think you do based on your past experience. The agent puts their hand on your left inner thigh, slowly moving it to the other side, before raising it to your groin, recalling their hand in clear disgust. The expression from the agent never changes. You’re asked to go ahead.

You decide to talk to the TSA agent. You don’t want to be touched, you doubt the agent wants to be touching people all day, maybe you can come to a compromise, as you inform the TSA agent that you’re trans and the detector will go off regardless. The one which had just ma’am’d you looks at you with disgust before yelling - in the crowded airport no less - “he says he’s trans.” The first agent walks over in confusion, and the both of them go to their manager, clogging the line behind you. “The scanner’s going to go off regardless,” you repeat, as the manager asks whether you would prefer your chest or groin be patted down. Apparently, answering “whichever one’s faster” is incorrect. The manager, quickly and awkwardly, pats down your chest, hands still lingering too long, before you’re let through.

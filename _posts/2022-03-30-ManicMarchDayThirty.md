# Manic March - Review

This is it - the last post for Manic March. There's one more day in March technically, but I've already written something for that day and it won't be public for awhile.

So what have I learned? I think that I've improved my writing ability a bit, but that's about it. I enjoy writing, and this has been a really nice creative outlet over the last month. There will be more posts, but I started running out of ideas, so they'll be more spaced out, thankfully. My shortest post is this one; my longest is 3000+ words. I've probably written 15-20k words this month overall, which is really cool!

For y'all who've been reading all of these, thank you :).

### What is Manic March?
On February 27, 2022, I thought it would be a great idea to create some sort of content - writing, art, coding, etc. - every day of the next month. Luckily, the alliteration worked out. This should be the thirtieth (and last!) post in the series.

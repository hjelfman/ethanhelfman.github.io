please ignore that it is halfway through july i've been busy traveling lmao!!!

### what i read in june

- basic writings of existentialism

i hate!!! nietzche. gibbering antisemetic nonsense. we love kierkegaard, don't we folks.

- conversations with friends by sally rooney

i love sally rooney's writing. to quote a friend, she uncovers the dirty, unwholesome thoughts that all of us have and lies them bare to have them reflected at us. i find myself uncomfortably seen in the worst aspects of all the terrible people in this book.

- the pearl by john steinbeck

i first read this in seventh(? funny how memory falls to time) grade. hits a lot closer to home now; i don't think that kids can understand the grief that the parents feel here as strongly. maybe i just have baby fever.

- the hours by michael cunningham

i am a woolf fan. cunningham nails down some of the finer aspects of her writing and brings ms. dalloway into the modern day in the process. i could not put it down.

- salt, fat, acid, heat by samin nosrat

i've been experiencing the omnivore's dilemna recently and i would like to know how to cook better. though i do not particularly care about variety (i could eat rice and beans every day if other people did not stop me), i'd like people to stop worrying about this at least and modify the way in which i eat these staples. i got some solid ideas from this book :)

- the mezzanine by baker nicholson

the mezzanine is a book about the thoughts of an office worker during his lunchbreak, lasting about an hour chronologically. my brain does not work like his but the way in which the narrarator thinks is how i concieve of many people around me which is both interesting and bleak.

- wuthering heights by emily bronte

i liked it!! read it during a rainy day and though it does not personally measure up to jane eyre, it was what was required of the day's atmosphere.

- the white album by joan didion

i liked it at the time but forget why.

- people who lunch by sally olds

the most overly-online book i have read recently (i say this with distain). if i hear one more word about polyamory i may vomit!

- pride and prejudice by jane austen

i love books which are just people talking in various houses. but seriously, the characterization in this novel is wonderful and i regret not having read it sooner.

- alphabetical diaries by sheila heti

interesting and well-executed concept. not much else to say aside from that it was fun attempting to puzzle her diaries back into chronological order!

- normal people by sally rooney

see above review. i liked conversations with friends better though.

- symphony of secrets by brendan slocumb

entertaining thriller-mystery. definitely 2016-core in politics.

- the invisible life of addie larue by victoria schwab

beautiful book about immortality, truth, and a love story. i did cry.

- xenofeminism

yea ok its right but what am i supposed to do about it.

- bad girls by camila sosa villada

i love magical realism so this was right up my alley! very enjoyable book about experiences orthagonal to my own.

- albions seed by david hackett fischer

reading this book was more entertaining than i thought it would be! the focus on reviews of this book (see, SSC) obscures this. it's interesting to look at today and attempt to strain out the elements of each folkway that lead us to this moment.

this has been long-delayed -- sorry! in the span between posts i've been moving and getting adjusted to cleveland; it's a beautiful, wonderful, friendly city, and its been a wonderful time so far. so great, in fact, that i haven't had the usual space to ruminate on my thoughts which would otherwise be posted here <3.

### what i read in july

- the second sex

wonderful. i've been reading this off and on for a while now; what finally spurred the drive to finish was a conversation with an older man at dinner about kierkegaard.

- the accomodation: the politics of race in an american city

i was born in dallas, texas in a neighborhood with a murkier history. as far as i'm aware, the division i lived in was constructed for the old dr. pepper factory (now a kroger) down the road. the history of this town and so many like it in the sunbelt has been buried by intrastate migration on the search for wealth. other people were here too.

- free food for millionaires

loved it!! good character study; was like sitting down with a friend.

- the horse, the wheel, and language

i think about the romans and the steppe nomads weekly -- to learn more about the latter i read this. incredibly interesting and informative; i heavily recommend it.

- the omnivore's dilemna

what is the right way to live? there is no one way, but one i have been struggling with is what to eat. faced with experiencing little hunger cues as of late and too much optionality in grocery stores, i had been defaulting to lentils and rice. it showed other ways to be.

- little heathens

sometimes i miss iowa.

- hyperion (series)

sci-fi recommended to me by nat, very good!!!!

- the soviet experiment

another gap in my historical knowledge has been the ussr; this was an incredibly informative book which helped fill it while giving a relatively unbiased view of the country's history.

### what i cooked

- rice and lentils with a lot of cumin again
- kachapuri
- chicken mole
- holodnik
- pasta alla norma
- peanut butter shortbread cookies
- bread pudding
- pecan sandies

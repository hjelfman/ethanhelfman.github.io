there currently is a crisis of masculinity in america, or perhaps the world[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10]. this is obviously uncontested but for the introduction to the 1994 edition of *the transsexual empire: the making of the she-male" by Janice G. Raymond, in which the author politely argues that trans women are more common than trans men due to want for an escape from rigid gender roles among other things. given that i do not particularly wish to engage with this entire book for a throwaway article, she later says:

>  Simone de Beauvoir gave us the insight that woman has been fabricated by man as “the other,” the relative being—relative to himself as the norm. So it should not be surprising that men, who have literally and figuratively, constructed women for centuries, are now “perfecting” the man-made women out of their own flesh.

so true bestie <3. 

is masculinity in crisis? have the borders between male and female gender roles become threadbare, permeable? if being a woman is so good, given that masculinity is in crisis, why are there still men? according to such brilliant minds, the problem of men should be solved right now. however, not all of us are such brilliant minds, and i myself will shine my five-lumen lightbulb upon the issue.

is masculinity in crisis? there have been various women's movements over time, each wave of which has sought a set of issues, be it voting rights, gender inequalities, a roughly-defined third wave, and ...intersectionality? it is hard to discuss an issue from the inside. uncontroversially, this has led to a decline in the confidence in the concept of "woman". matt walsh, hmu. the dissolution of gendered norms has likely made it more difficult to define what a woman is; this is not the eighteenth century, not all women have to give birth anymore. if birth, childrearing, domesticity, all options which have historically limited women's ability to live free lives, are not required of them, then what is left? 

according to wittig's *the category of sex*, there is a "sex that is oppressed and a sex that oppresses". despite failures which have set back the ability for women to make their own choices, there have been amazing strides in the reduction of oppression. if categories are assigned by who oppresses and who is the oppressed, the empowerment of the oppressed makes it more difficult to define oppressors. 

wise thinkers such as matt walsh and picrew avatars on twitter have difficulty discussing "what is a woman" because women have been defined as that which men are not, those who are oppressed by men. this inability to discuss the issue leads us to the _crisis in masculinity_.

what are men without women? matt walsh doesn't even do his own dishes. joking aside, masculinity is in crisis because it is no longer defined as that which it is not. you can see this in the male longing for 1950s advertising, tradwives, etc. seeking a defined role in society. raymond makes a salient point: 

> There has been no comparable “men’s movement” which has confronted, in an organized and political way, masculine gender roles, male sexual identity, and manhood standards.

if one deals in a conception of gender as oppressor/oppressed, the reason for this is obvious - the inability of men to form a coherent, popular men's movement is due to their inability to make the situation for themselves any better than it already is.

so why are there still men? there will always be a conception of men as long as there is an oppressed underclass to define them. 

to answer the original implication (why are there still men?), it is not due to a power dynamic, but rather implies that gender comes to exist via other categories, the implication left up to the reader whether this be good[^11] or bad[^12]. 

an astute reader will notice that the title reads "how to be a real man", not "what is a real man". luckily, you have a true expert in masculinity, me, to ask you some vital questions. 

there's this feeling that i get when i do my makeup, partially because i cannot see clearly, or barely at all, out of my left eye, that it's always uneven. i know its not, except for when it is. regardless, i *think* its wrong. it shifts before my eyes looking in the mirror, forming itself into shapes to inform me that i, again, am failing to perceive what is there. the first time i did my makeup was at a friend's house during high school. 

what happens when you look at your body in the mirror? does it shift, rotate, look slightly off? does it belong to you? lift an arm - was it the arm you thought you would move. is your brain connected to your body? if not there, then where? i remember looking at myself in the mirror in elementary school. it never looked the same. cartesian dualism is nice because you are not yourself.

have you ever felt like you're in your body - can you name an experience in which you did? in elementary school, i built houses for bugs so they would have a home to live in; a bug is just its body. does a bug feel embodied? it has to, for it has no mind to differentiate itself. my body was a machine that my brain controls, running on read-only hardware, playing in third-person shooter mode. the camera grew further and further away. the hardware degrading as i grew. however, i am mostly my body nowadays, by brain operates in perfect unison with my body. 

the solution to degradation is running a machine into the ground, obviously.

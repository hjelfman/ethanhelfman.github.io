>Woe to me, my mother, that you ever bore a son.
>
>What a great loss and no gain!
>
>I was created closed-eyed and hardhearted.
>
>Uncircumcised of heart and flesh was I born.
>
>At three days, they cut my umbilical cord,
>
>and at eight days my foreskin.
>
>However, my ears, heart, and mind [remained uncircumcised and] 
>
>were not ready to join Hashem’s covenant.
>
>They didn’t take off their disgrace
>
>Or remove it from their being.
>
>Their foreskin indeed remains as a blemish.
>
>For a lie they guarded hitherward, and for nothing they labored.
>
>That from the day they were brought into the world that is all darkness,
>
>they were not circumcised.
>
>
>Cursed be the one who announced to my father:
>
>“It’s a boy!
>
>He will be intelligent and superior to a prophet.
>
>The holy work will be his as with Yishmael ben Pavia
>
>Upon the mountains of spice he will run like the gazelle and like the deer
>
>He will not be defiled from the start by the filth-idols of his people
>
>He will erect the hall of science on its mound.
>
>The candle will shine from his head
>
>and those who walk in darkness will follow his radiant halo.”
>
>This messenger shall be held guilty of bloodshed; cursed be he.
>
>How could he twist the course of the stars so much?
>
>How could he have erred so in his astrology?
>
>A lying tongue, a fool’s mouth it had given him
>
>For he foolishly transformed justice to poison
>
>He altered the law and transposed the lines
>
>
>
>Woe to him who has male sons
>
>Upon them a heavy yoke has been placed of restrictions and constraints.
>
>Some in private, some in public
>
>some to avoid the mere appearance of violation
>
>and some entering the most secret of places.
>
>Severe statutes and awesome commandments
>
>six hundred and thirteen
>
>who is the man who is capable
>
>of fulfilling them all to the letter?
>
>How will he escape
>
>be he diligent or lazy?
>
>How will he not stumble?
>
>And even if he observed all these,
>
>he is not yet done with his list of duties.
>
>For the (wicked) impulse is resourceful and scheming
>
>If one cannot engross in Torah-study and analyze sharply
>
>Interpretations of Torah and practice
>
>Sifra, Sifri, Tosefta, and the entire Talmud
>
>

>Seven are the pillars of wisdom.
>
>They soar far above any mountain or hill.
>
>Here is Logic;
>
>[here are] the valley of Philosophy and the vale of vision,
>
>and the secrets of Arithmetic and Geometry
>
>They will not believe it can be told;
>
>and the wisdom of Measurements…
>
>they will not obtain it; the people’s pleasures in Field and Plane
>
>by which the seeker can measure
>
>the heights of heaven and the depth of abyss.
>
>Those dwelling in an observatory cannot (measure)
>
>the extent of the Celestial Map
>
>and if the wheel rotates yet the constellations remain fixed
>
>if they are weary wanderers.
>
>[Those are] the seven steps of the ladder.
>
>And who will praise the prowess [needed for] 
>
>the study of the divine and the pure forms,
>
>which are ten, namely the Ten Sefirot [of the kabbalah] –
>
>who can express such fortitude?
>
>
>
>How badly was he stricken by the finger
>
>how much shame must he put up with,
>
>he who was minted in the coin die of men!
>
>His field is blighted 
>
>Better who carries him than creates him!
>
>
>Oh, but had the artisan who made me created me instead – a worthy woman.
>
>Today I would be wise and insightful.
>
>We would weave, my friends and I
>
>and in the moonlight spin our yarn
>
>and tell our stories to one another
>
>from dusk till midnight
>
>we’d tell of the events of our day, silly things

>matters of no consequence.
>
>But also I would grow very wise from the spinning
>
>and I would say, “How lucky am I” to know how to make linen,
>
>how to comb [wool], and weave lace;
>
>[to design] cup-like buds, open flowers, cherubim, palm trees,
>
>and all sorts of other fine things,
>
>colorful embroideries and furrow-like stitches.”
>
>
>And oft-times,
>
>in the way of women,
>
>I would lie down on the kitchen floor,

>
>On holidays
>
>I would put on my best jewelry.
>
>I would beat on the drum and my clapping hands would ring.
>
>
>
>And when I was ready and the time was right

>increase my delight and gladness.
>
>Were I hungry, he would feed me well-kneaded bread.

>Were I thirsty, he would quench me with light and dark wine
>
>
>He would not chastise nor harshly treat me,

>his head would rest upon my breast.
>
>The three husbandly duties he would fulfill

>And parallel to [his] three wifely duties would I also fulfill three,

>[watching for menstrual] blood, [Shabbat candle] flame, and [taking dough for] ḥallah,
>
>Sweeter than honey are these three, so powerful,

>“Whereby do women earn merit?”
>
>
>
>Father in heaven
>
>who did miracles for our ancestors with fire and water
>
>You transformed the fire of Ur Kasdim so it would not burn [Avraham] 
>
>You transformed Dinah in the womb of her mother [Leah, to a girl] 
>
>You transformed the staff [of Moshe] to a snake before a million eyes
>
>You transformed (Moshe’s) hand to (leprous) white

>and the Sea of Reeds to dry land.
>
>and the sea floor into solid and dried-up earth

>
>Who would then transform me from a man to woman?

>Were I only to have merited this being so graced by goodness

>
>What shall I say?

>
>If my father in heaven has decreed upon me

From *Even Bohan*, by Kalonymus ben Kalonymus (1322 C.E.)

Today's date, 3/31 multiplies to 93. In Jewish Gematria, the word "her" corresponds to 93, as [nothing is ever a coincidence](https://unsongbook.com/). Some other words that have the same value are "home", "help", "chara" - meaning joy, "end a game", and "baggage claim", all of which apply to today but "baggage claim". The significance of this date is that it is TDOV - trans day of acceptance - a day that began in Michigan when I was nine years old. Of note is that the word "Michigan" has a value of 107, which it has in common with "his", "grief", and the letters "t" + "g" because, again, nothing is ever a coincidence. 

I don't quite remember what I was doing on 3/31/2009; it's one of the many issues with having an extremely poor autobiographical memory. Inferring however, I was in fourth grade, in my second semester at a new school, W.B. Travis. The fact that I don't remember it implies that I was likely having a suboptimal time. Then again, how can I know if I don't remember it? This seems to be a recurring theme in the writing I've done in the past month, along with sentences and paragraphs that go nowhere, attempting to digress from the central point of the writing while I struggle to find the words necessary to make the next point.

However, this is different. The thought that I wish to express has been written in so many other ways, better than I ever could, that expressing it would be trite. Kalonymus said it best in grief; it always astounds me when the same thought is expressed again and again over centuries of writing. We are not so seperated from those before us as we would like to believe. However, Kalonymus "will bear and suffer until I die and wither in the ground." In 1322, this was a natural conclusion of Kalonymus' grief; in 2022, not so much. I've been beating around the bush for twenty-one years, three paragraphs, and one poem - I do not wish to do it for any longer. I'm trans.

The question I concerned myself with for at least four years - again, I have a horrible memory, this could be much longer - is "how can I know for certain?" The value of truth is still in fiery debate after thousands of years, with no clear winner. The ultimate answer which works for me is that there is a disjoint between how I feel, how I am, and how I appear, and those three's difference fall along a gendered axis. Any other questioning beyond that is for nerds; digging a hole for the sake of digging is of no use. The next question was what I was to do about it. Four years ago, my answer was investigate - of note is that the gematria value for "investigate" is 1066 - the year of the Battle of Hastings; as well, the phrase "I hope you're right" has a value of 1066+9 years old-4 years=1071, because again, nothing is ever a coincidence. Two years ago, COVID hit, and I don't remember much else. One year ago, my answer was "bear and suffer", which has a value of 520, sharing this quality with the word "matrix", the name of a movie directed by two trans women. I'm really having too much fun with gematria. Sometime last May, I realized that lying down to rot wasn't the right answer; it wasn't like me at all. Doing that is equivalent to dying before you actually do, for if you fail to change and grow, you fail to be a human. I didn't like that.

"Last May? Are you telling me-" No, I'm not, there were a few more questions I had to answer, a few ducks to get in line. But, I told my partner in December(? - again, poor memory!) of 2021, when I was more than reasonably sure. Then the final answer was left; I needed to be able to prove to myself, for my own sake. With A/B testing and some questionably-obtained HRT, I was able to answer this as well, sometime in late Feburary. Obviously, there's a lot of work to be done; if only I were to live away from other people for six months in order to do some of it in private (for example, a state with low population density such as Iowa). If only I were that good at planning ahead.

Like I said, a lot to be done. That being said, I would like to come out to a limited number of people, and today's date, while arbitrary, seems to be just as good as any. There are 136 days between today and my twenty-second birthday - may it be different than my twenty-first. Coincidetally, 136 is the value of "I am free" in Jewish gematria. And today, while writing this letter, I sure feel that way. I could talk about how I feel a feeling best described as "embodied", or the joy of seeing myself in ways I'd like to. I could talk about the more painful parts of the past four years as well. Neither feels appropriate. We exist in all forms, good and bad, but always moving forward. Let's dwell on the present and future. It feels good to be me in the present. I am excited for the future, much more than I have been, ever. I hope that y'all will be there for me, in the present and future. That is what matters.

With all the care in the world,

Your fellow person-in-the-world, editor, scribe, enemy, gremlin, robotics team captain, vaguely parental figure, chaffeur, pyromaniac, writer, and friend,

Hazel C. Helfman

P.S.

Don't share this letter - or its contents - right now unless you know the other person's read it; I'm a little bit of a walking disaster, and will be for a bit longer. I've lived with twenty-one years of the status quo - I can wait until I leave Iowa for that to change. Or sooner - who knows what I'm going to do - I sure don't! Feel free to ask questions, etc. of course, anything you want to know, I'll probably answer them truthfully :^). 

P.P.S

Question I'm going to answer rn so that people don't ask: "What does the 'C' stand for?" I didn't want my initials to be HHH - I'm not a Marvel character - and I really wanted to have some sort of Hebrew name like "Hannah". Luckily, "Hannah" is just as easily transliterated "Chana".

I keep on thinking of more things to add to this, which is really frustrating because I hate reading my own work. So, I'm just gonna add a Q&A below.

Q: Why didn't you mention this before? Some people I know came out before starting HRT.

A: I hate the mortifying ordeal of being known.


Q: Why can't I tell other people?

A: Cmon.


Q: I am mad about this.

A: Sucks,,, also not a question


Q: What's up with the gematria stuff?

A: Thought it would be funny also don't know how to change the subject in writing.


Q: post dosage.

A: 4mg e @ 1mg every six-ish hours sublingually; 50mg spiro will go up to 100mg when i get my blood test results or when i figure out how to order medicine from vanatu.


Q: Is any of this sarcastic? 

A: Not the parts that are important.


Q: Can I tell (insert person)?

A: Ask me first please :)


Q: So does everyone in the below thanks list know?

A: No, so you probably shouldn't tell them unless you ask the above!


Q: What's the funniest pickle you've gotten yourself into?

A: I was picking up people for chapter retreat(?) last year and one of the pledges in the car made the Subaru joke(TM). I sometimes do not understand things and thought the pledge had figured everything out, so I was bracing myself before realizing "oh yeah i do actually drive a subaru". Whoops.


Q: What are the consequences for me telling other people?

A: Nothing for you! Unfortunately, a portion of my family is rather conservative, and there may be reprecussions for me if they somehow find out. I'd like to be slightly more independent - read: have my own health insurance - before that happens.

Thank to all of you, in no particular order (this list, save for one name, is randomized every time the page is loaded - test it out!):

<p id="names">Trinidad Fleming, </p>

All of you have helped me in some way; I will be forever thankful for that.

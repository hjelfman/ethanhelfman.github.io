Hello! I'm /name/, an amateur coder and aspiring chemical engineering student in Austin. My research area is currently in the analysis of protein images using machine learning and other methods. Aside from that, I have a few sparse projects scattered across my GitHub from high school and robotics. Outside of coding, I enjoy writing, both technical and other, and have previously written on inequities in IRS audit rates among poorer and more diverse areas. Historically, I have done some GIS work for mapping election results, working for a congressional campaign. My past work experience includes technical writing for the Texas government, data management, and tech support. This site, eventually, will serve as a repository for my various projects that I wish to share.

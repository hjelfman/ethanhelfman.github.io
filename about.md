Howdy! I'm a chemical engineering student at an unspecified university, with experience in large-scale manufacturing, wet lab processes, machine learning, and coding. I have one published paper with another on the way; these are not currently linked because I enjoy having some sense of anonymity while posting on the World Wide Web. Mostly, this website is a place for me to put my writing; I tend to write in a flurry of activity every March, with a little bit more added during the rest of the year. Have a good time :)!
